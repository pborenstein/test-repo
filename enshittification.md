Based on Cory Doctorow's analysis, here are the steps of enshittification (the decline of digital platforms):

## First Stage - Platform Growth

- Platform starts by offering excellent service to users
- Attracts users with quality content and features
- Keeps things fair and beneficial for all parties
- Subsidizes users to build the user base

## Second Stage - Creator/Supplier Focus

- Once users are locked in, platform shifts focus to creators/suppliers
- Begins extracting value from users to benefit suppliers
- Makes the platform increasingly attractive to businesses
- Gradually decreases user experience quality

## Third Stage - Shareholder Maximization

- After both users and suppliers are dependent on the platform
- Begins extracting maximum value from both users and suppliers
- Prioritizes shareholder profits above all else
- Degrades service quality for both sides
- Introduces more ads, fees, and restrictions

## Final Stage - Platform Decline

- Users and suppliers start looking for alternatives
- Platform quality continues to deteriorate
- Trust erodes across all stakeholders
- Platform becomes increasingly hostile to users
- Eventually leads to platform abandonment

This cycle has been observed in many major digital platforms, from social media to e-commerce sites. The key characteristic is the gradual shift from serving users' interests to extracting maximum value from all participants.
