So looks like the native dictation is better anyway let's see if we can do the story about Gil so I drove him around a lot. This time we were driving through Newton and the traffic was all bumper-to-bumper and people were doing stupid things and I was responding to them as they should, so from the back I hear a little voice. Hey dad and I say yeah girl

And he says, "Hey, Dad? Is asshole the name for another driver?"
