So I know a lot about ASD and if you've been in the ASD community, you know that if you've seen one kid with ASDASD you've seen one kid with ASD so my son went to school for kids like him learning differences we call him and one of the things you notice at a school for ASD kids is that all of these kids have parents and you'll see them you know like a pick up time or sometimes they'll be science fairs, or award ceremony or something and you know you'll know the parents usually hang out for a little bit before the kids come down from the classroom and that you talk to them and some of these you talk to them for a while and you like I can see why you have a kid in this school yeah I can see that but of course they're thinking the same thing about you
