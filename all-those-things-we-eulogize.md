# All those things we eulogize

all those things we eulogize
remember as a golden time
all those ages
all those eras
none
lasted more than five years or so
that is the time it takes
for people to be charmed
feel safe
and ultimately betray each other

it is because they made fun of their friends that Fitzgerald and Hemingway are remembered but who remembers
[[Gerald Murphy|Sarah and Gerald Murphy]]

these ages are short because human life is short
to sustain
the Algonquin
the Summer of Love
Paris in the 20s
the beatniks
the eighties for crying out loud
