# 80s Sound archive

Download 30GB of lost cassettes from the 80s underground

Looking for a captivating way to spend the rest of your week? [Archive.org](http://Archive.org) has uncovered an enormous collection of cassettes spanning from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s.

This 30GB collection, originally preserved by [noise-arch.net](http://noise-arch.net), was donated in August 2009 by former CKLN-FM radio host Myke Dyer. While the archive hasn't been fully cataloged due to its size and obscurity, it reportedly includes a fascinating mix of "tape experimentation, industrial, avant-garde, indie, rock, DIY, subvertainment, and auto-hypnotic materials."

You can dive into this massive collection and download it for free on Archive.org. \[Via *Electronic Beats*\]

Meanwhile, we're still exploring another incredible find on Archive: the nostalgic and essential *Attention Kmart Shoppers*, a collection of vintage in-store background music
